# Budget Tracker Project
Monthly budget tracker project 

The budget tracking program is a Java based program that will allow a user to setup a budget and track all expenditures from the budget account. This program will follow the “envelope” budgeting method, which allows a user to setup an amount to be deposited across multiple spending or saving categories. The program will have the user setup all categories that they would like to track spending from. The user can either fund their categories manually or setup a monthly recurring payment that would be divided among the categories as specified. 

The program will allow a user to manually add expenditures as they occur against each category. The program will also allow the user to input a group of expenditures from a banking statement if desired. In the case of a banking statement the user will be asked to allocate a spending category for each charge as the program won’t know the categories by vendor names in the document. 

The final use for this program will be to create a user requested report. The user can request a spending report by month or since inception. This will provide the user with a visual report as to how their budget is working and which categories might need to be looked at.
